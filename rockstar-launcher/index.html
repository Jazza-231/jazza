            <h1>Rockstar Launcher Documentation</h1>
            <p>
               This is going to be a long documentation of my experience with
               the Rockstar Launcher. It will be sent to various forums,
               Rockstar Support, and Steam in the hope of helping others.
            </p>

            <h2>The Issue</h2>
            <p>
               Upon trying to launch RDR2, the launcher would attempt to update.
               It would open two admin prompts and ultimately fail the update
               with the following error message:
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong
                  >“The Social Club failed to load due to an incomplete
                  installation (code 1002). Please exit the game and reinstall
                  the latest version of the Social Club:
                  <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com"
                     >https://support.rockstargames.com</a
                  >.”</strong
               >
            </p>

            <h2>Support Experience</h2>
            <p>
               I dutifully followed the support link to reinstall the latest
               version of the Social Club. Issue 1: There is no clear link for
               installing the Social Club. Upon further investigation, this is
               not something you can install yourself; it should say you need to
               install the Rockstar Launcher.
            </p>
            <p>
               I opened a support chat and detailed what I knew of my issue: the
               error code. Over the course of 7 hours, they gave me multiple
               steps, including fully removing the Rockstar Launcher multiple
               times, reinstalling it, disabling antivirus and firewalls,
               changing DNS servers, multiple restarts, and a system repair
               using <code>SFC scannow</code>. Nothing worked, and I received
               the same error message every single time.
            </p>
            <p>
               I would like to add that this would not have happened if Rockstar
               did not insist on using an external launcher.
            </p>

            <h2>Reinstalling Windows</h2>
            <p>
               Finally, I tried reinstalling Windows using the option to keep my
               apps. I downloaded an ISO and used Rufus to create a bootable
               USB, but I could not use this to reinstall Windows while keeping
               my apps, as the language I had chosen was American English,
               whereas my device is using British English. A stupid reason, made
               more stupid by the fact that the ISO choices are American English
               and International English, with no British option. I eventually
               used the Windows Installation Media Creation Tool to make a
               bootable USB, which I used to reinstall Windows. Upon trying to
               launch RDR2, it worked! But why?
            </p>
            <p>
               When I first installed RDR2, I had OneDrive preinstalled by
               Microsoft. After installing RDR2, I uninstalled OneDrive and
               moved the Documents folder from
               <code>C:/Users/username/OneDrive</code> to
               <code>C:/Users/username</code>. The Rockstar Launcher stores
               files in the Documents folder, and upon moving it, the launcher
               didn't know where to look. This was never mentioned in the
               support chat as a possibility. Reinstalling Windows puts the
               Documents folder back into the OneDrive folder, thus fixing the
               issue. I hope anyone experiencing a similar issue can use this to
               help them. I will be sending this to Rockstar in the hope they
               add this to their troubleshooting. I also ask them to change
               their launcher code to take this into consideration
               automatically. Normally, the Documents folder is in one of two
               places: <code>C:/Users/username/Documents</code>, or
               <code>C:/Users/username/OneDrive/Documents</code>. It should not
               be hard to check both of these locations.
            </p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  If you are having problems with the Rockstar Launcher failing
                  a Social Club update, try moving your Documents folder from
                  <code>C:/Users/username/Documents</code> to
                  <code>C:/Users/username/OneDrive/Documents</code> or
                  vice-versa.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Windows team: Please don't change the location of critical
                  folders because you want us to use OneDrive.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Rockstar team: Please check the two common locations and/or
                  add this step to your troubleshooting.
